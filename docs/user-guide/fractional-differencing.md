# Fractional Differencing

Fractional differencing (FFD) produces stationary time series while preserving long-range memory — the key insight from De Prado (2018, Chapter 5). Standard first-differencing (d=1) achieves stationarity but destroys predictive signal; fractional differencing finds the minimum d that passes stationarity tests.

Use the [Book Guide](../book-guide/index.md) for the surrounding Chapter 9 workflow
and the case-study files that use FFD in production pipelines.

Use this page when you need stationary inputs but do not want to destroy the
predictive structure in price series with full differencing.

## The Memory-Stationarity Tradeoff

| Differencing Degree | Stationarity | Memory Preserved | ML Utility |
|---------------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| d = 0 (original) | Non-stationary | 100% | Poor (unit root) |
| 0 < d < 0.5 | May be stationary | High | Optimal zone |
| d = 0.5 | Borderline | Moderate | Acceptable |
| d = 1 (first diff) | Stationary | ~0% | Poor (signal lost) |

The goal: find the smallest d where the ADF test rejects the null hypothesis of a unit root (p-value < 0.05).

## Core Functions

### `ffdiff` — Apply Fractional Differencing

```python
from ml4t.engineer.features.fdiff import ffdiff

# As a Polars expression (chainable)
result = df.with_columns(
    ffdiff("close", d=0.4, threshold=1e-5).alias("close_ffd")
)

# Or on a Series directly
ffd_series = ffdiff(df["close"], d=0.4)
```

**Parameters**:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `close` | `pl.Series \| pl.Expr \| str` | required | Price series or column name |
| `d` | `float` | required | Differencing degree (0 to 2) |
| `threshold` | `float` | `1e-5` | Minimum weight magnitude (truncation) |

**How it works**: FFD applies a weighted sum of lagged values where weights are derived from the fractional binomial expansion. Weights decay geometrically, and the `threshold` parameter truncates negligibly small weights for efficiency. Weights are cached via `@lru_cache` and the inner loop is Numba-accelerated.

### `find_optimal_d` — Find Minimum Stationary d

```python
from ml4t.engineer.features.fdiff import find_optimal_d

result = find_optimal_d(
    close=df["close"],          # Must be a pl.Series (not Expr)
    d_range=(0.0, 1.0),        # Search range
    step=0.01,                  # Step size (finer = slower)
    adf_pvalue_threshold=0.05,  # ADF significance level
)

print(result)
# {"optimal_d": 0.35, "adf_pvalue": 0.023, "correlation": 0.97}
```

**Returns** a dict with:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `optimal_d` | Smallest d passing ADF test |
| `adf_pvalue` | ADF p-value at optimal d |
| `correlation` | Correlation between original and FFD series |

A high correlation (>0.90) means most of the predictive information is preserved.

### `fdiff_diagnostics` — Full Diagnostic Report

```python
from ml4t.engineer.features.fdiff import fdiff_diagnostics

diag = fdiff_diagnostics(
    close=df["close"],
    d=0.4,
    threshold=1e-5,
)

print(diag)
# {"d": 0.4, "adf_statistic": -3.21, "adf_pvalue": 0.019,
#  "correlation": 0.96, "n_weights": 127, "weight_sum": 0.998}
```

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Find Optimal d

```python
import polars as pl
from ml4t.engineer.features.fdiff import find_optimal_d, ffdiff

# Load price data
df = pl.read_parquet("spy_daily.parquet")

# Find minimum d for stationarity
result = find_optimal_d(df["close"], step=0.01)
optimal_d = result["optimal_d"]
print(f"Optimal d: {optimal_d}, ADF p-value: {result['adf_pvalue']:.4f}")
print(f"Correlation with original: {result['correlation']:.4f}")
```

### 2. Apply Fractional Differencing

```python
# Apply FFD with optimal d
df = df.with_columns(
    ffdiff("close", d=optimal_d).alias("close_ffd")
)
```

### 3. Validate with ADF Test

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

adf_result = adfuller(df["close_ffd"].drop_nulls().to_numpy())
print(f"ADF statistic: {adf_result[0]:.4f}")
print(f"p-value: {adf_result[1]:.6f}")
# Should be < 0.05
```

### 4. Use as ML Feature

```python
# FFD series is now stationary but retains memory
# Use alongside other features
from ml4t.engineer import compute_features

features = compute_features(df, ["rsi", "macd", "atr"])
features = features.with_columns(
    ffdiff("close", d=optimal_d).alias("close_ffd")
)
```

## Via compute_features

Fractional differencing is also available through the standard `compute_features` API:

```python
result = compute_features(df, [
    {"name": "fractional_diff", "params": {"d": 0.4}},
])
```

Or find the optimal d and apply it:

```python
result = compute_features(df, [
    {"name": "ffdiff_optimal", "params": {"adf_pvalue_threshold": 0.05}},
])
```

## Asset-Class Guidelines

Typical optimal d values (these are starting points — always validate on your data):

| Asset Class | Typical d Range | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Equity indices (SPY, QQQ) | 0.3 - 0.5 | Strong trend component |
| Individual stocks | 0.3 - 0.6 | Higher variance, may need larger d |
| Futures (ES, NQ) | 0.2 - 0.4 | Session structure affects ADF |
| FX pairs | 0.3 - 0.5 | Mean-reverting pairs may need lower d |
| Crypto | 0.4 - 0.7 | High volatility, regime-dependent |

### Multi-Asset Application

For multi-asset pipelines, compute optimal d per asset:

```python
for symbol in ["SPY", "QQQ", "IWM"]:
    asset_data = df.filter(pl.col("symbol") == symbol)
    result = find_optimal_d(asset_data["close"])
    print(f"{symbol}: d={result['optimal_d']}, corr={result['correlation']:.3f}")
```

## Performance

- Weights computed once and cached (`@lru_cache`)
- Inner loop Numba-accelerated
- Weight truncation via `threshold` limits computation window
- Typical: 383 lines of implementation for the full module
